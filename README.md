## Titanic Survival Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project delves into the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival employing machine learning techniques. It encompasses a thorough process including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model selection, and deployment.

### Key Components:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming the dataset to ensure it's suitable for analysis and modeling.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Exploring and visualizing the data to gain insights into patterns, correlations, and potential predictive features.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features or modifying existing ones to enhance the predictive power of the model.
4. **Model Selection**: Evaluating various machine learning algorithms to determine the best-performing model for predicting survival.
5. **Deployment**: Utilizing Flask and Ngrok to deploy the predictive model, enabling real-time predictions via a web interface.

### Repository Contents:
- Jupyter Notebooks: Detailed walkthroughs of each stage of the project, including code and explanations.
- Python Scripts: Modularized code for data preprocessing, modeling, and deployment.
- Trained Model: A pre-trained machine learning model ready for use, allowing for replication and further development.

This project is designed to serve as a comprehensive resource for understanding and implementing machine learning techniques for predictive modeling, with a focus on real-world applicability.
